<h2>Task 1</h2>
<ul>
<li>Change the top 2 menu items on the left side bar to
<ol>
<li>Create Offer</li>
<li>List Offers</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>

<p>On click of the menu item (for example Create Offer), display a
<strong>modal dialog</strong> with only the message <em>To be
implemented</em>. This dialog should have a <strong>close
button</strong> as well as an <strong>X</strong> at the top right.
When either of them are clicked it should close the dialog.</p>

<h2>Task 2</h2>

<h4>Validations</h4>
<p>When submitted, the <strong>Name</strong> field
should <strong>NOT</strong> be empty with a <strong>maximum of 12
characters</strong>. The <strong>Offer ID</strong> field should
<strong>NOT</strong> be empty and accept <strong>only a minimum of 4 and maximum of 10
numerals</strong>. Display an appropriate error message if the
validation fails. This error message should appear at the top of the
search form. <strong>Do Not</strong> use an alert box.</p>

<h4>AJAX</h4>
<p>On successfull validations, send an AJAX <strong>GET</strong>
  request to <strong>http://localhost:3005/items</strong>. You will
  receive JSON data exactly as below.</p>

  <pre>
    {
    "items": [

<h4>User Interface (Optional, but bonus points if implemented)</h4>
  <p>
Make sure that when the submit button is clicked it is <strong>disabled</strong> so
that the user cannot click it again. Also display a <strong>loading icon</strong> like
a spinner, where the results table should appear.</p>

<h3>The results table</h3>

<p>Display the above received JSON data as shown below in a HTML
  table. Please use the <strong>table</strong> element and style it
  using CSS.</p>

<p>On mouse hover of the results table <strong>highlight the current
  row</strong>. Also make the table rows <strong>striped</strong>, i.e. alternate rows
  should have the same color for UI enhancements</p>

<p>
Bonus points if you implement sorting!</p>
